    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbs plus 2 tsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tbs plus 2 tsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        <li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
        <li>1lb Yukon Gold potatoes</li>
        <li>2 quarts cold water</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 tbs unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Cayenne Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>2 qts veg oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the Béchamel: In a small saucepan, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming. Add flour and whisk to form a paste. Lower heat to medium and cook, whisking constantly, until raw flour smell is gone but flour has not browned, about 1 minute. While whisking constantly, slowly pour milk in a thin, steady stream until all of it has been added, and continue to cook, stirring often, until béchamel is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg to taste. Transfer to small bowl and cover with plastic wrap, pressing plastic against surface to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside. </li>
        <li>For the Potato Croquettes: In a 3-quart saucepan, combine potatoes, water, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until potatoes are tender and offer little resistance when pierced with a paring knife, about 10 minutes. Drain potatoes, then transfer back to now-empty saucepan.</li>
        <li>Set saucepan over low heat, shaking saucepan constantly, until moisture has evaporated from potatoes, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pass potatoes through a ricer into a medium bowl, then allow them to cool slightly, about 2 minutes. Using a flexible spatula, stir in butter and season with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using) to taste. Stir in béchamel until thoroughly combined, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Line rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Using a 1-tablespoon cookie scoop or measuring spoon, scoop potato-béchamel mixture onto prepared baking sheet; you should have 28 portions. Using your hands, roll each portion into a ball between your palms (dough should be soft but not sticky) and return to prepared baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1 and up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Position bowls with flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs next to prepared baking sheet. Working with one ball at a time, roll ball completely in flour, transfer to beaten eggs and roll to coat on all sides, then place in breadcrumbs, turning to coat completely. Return to prepared baking sheet and repeat breading process with remaining balls. Transfer baking sheet with breaded croquettes to refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 200°F (95°C). Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line with paper towels. In a Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat to 340°F (170°C). Working in batches of 7, carefully add breaded croquettes to hot oil using a spider or slotted spoon. Fry, turning pieces as they cook, until golden brown on all sides, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer croquettes to prepared wire rack, season with salt, and transfer to oven to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Return oil to 340°F (170°C) and repeat frying with remaining breaded croquettes, continuing to work in batches of 7. Transfer croquettes to a serving bowl and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
