    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chickpea flour</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground red chile powder, such as Kashmiri</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2 cups cold water</li>
        <li>1 lrg head cauliflower, about 1 1/2 lbs</li>
        <li>4 cups veg oil</li>
        <li>Green chutney</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the chickpea flour, salt, red chile powder, turmeric, and garam masala together. Whisk in the water until completely smooth. The batter should be runny like a custard and not too thick or thin. Fold the cauliflower florets into the batter to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>In a 6-quart Dutch oven or wok, heat oil over medium heat until it reaches 350ºF (177ºC). Meanwhile, set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet or line the baking sheet with paper towels. Working in batches to prevent crowding the oil, use your fingers or tongs to lift cauliflower from batter, allowing excess to drain off, then carefully lower into the oil. Fry, stirring and rotating pieces gently as they cook, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 6 minutes.  Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer the fried florets to the prepared baking sheet and season with salt.. Return oil to 350ºF (177ºC) and repeat with remaining cauliflower florets. Serve hot or warm.</li>
